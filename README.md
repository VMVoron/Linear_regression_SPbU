##  Discussion:

##    The death rate is to be represented as a function of other variables.

###    There are 60 rows of data.  The data includes:

      I,   the index;
      A1,  the average annual precipitation;
      A2,  the average January temperature;
      A3,  the average July temperature;
      A4,  the size of the population older than 65;
      A5,  the number of members per household;
      A6,  the number of years of schooling for persons over 22;
      A7,  the number of households with fully equipped kitchens;
      A8,  the population per square mile; 
      A9,  the size of the nonwhite population;
      A10, the number of office workers;
      A11, the number of families with an income less than $3000;
      A12, the hydrocarbon pollution index;
      A13, the nitric oxide pollution index;
      A14, the sulfur dioxide pollution index;
      A15, the degree of atmospheric moisture.
      B,   the death rate.

##    We seek a model of the form:

      B =  A1 *  X1 +  A2 *  X2 +  A3 *  X3 +  A4 *  X4 +  A5 *  X5
        +  A6 *  X6 +  A7 *  X7 +  A8 *  X8 +  A9 *  X9 + A10 * X10
       + A11 * X11 + A12 * X12 + A13 * X13 + A14 * X14 + A15 * X15
